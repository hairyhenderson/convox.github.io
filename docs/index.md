## What is Convox?

Convox is an open source [Platform as a Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) that runs in your own Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.

To start using Convox, you'll need to install the command line interface (CLI) onto your OS X or Linux computer. Then you can use the `convox` CLI to install the PaaS system into your AWS account.

Once that's all set up you can start deploying and managing your apps with Convox, without having to worry about the underlying AWS services.

Follow the step-by-step guide below to get started.


## Install the CLI

##### OSX
    $ curl -Ls https://www.convox.com/downloads/osx/convox.zip > /tmp/convox.zip
    $ unzip /tmp/convox.zip -d /usr/local/bin

##### Linux
    $ curl -Ls https://www.convox.com/downloads/linux/convox.zip > /tmp/convox.zip
    $ unzip /tmp/convox.zip -d /usr/local/bin

## Install Convox in AWS

The `convox install` command will kick off the process of setting up Convox in your AWS account. All of the AWS resources required for creating a powerful app deployment platform will be correctly configured for you.

    $ convox install

  <h3>Security credentials</h3>
  <p>To install Convox into your AWS account, the Convox CLI needs an <code>AWS Access Key ID</code> and <code>Secret Access Key</code>. We highly recommend following AWS best practices by <a href="/docs/creating-an-iam-user-and-credentials">creating a new IAM user to supply these credentials</a>. Once the install is complete you can safely <a href="/docs/deleting-an-iam-user">delete the user</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="block-callout block-show-callout type-primary">
  <h3>Rack Region</h3>
  <p>A Rack exists in one AWS region. Since Convox depends on specific AWS services you can't deploy Racks in all regions. Currently AWS regions that support both <em>Lambda</em> and <em>EC2 Container Service</em> are supported.</p>
  <p>Region can be specified on Rack install using the <code>--region</code> flag.</p>
</div>

The installation process takes about 5 minutes. Go make a sandwich while you contemplate all of the AWS docs you're not reading and glue code you're not writing.

    Waiting for load balancer...

When the load balancer becomes available the installation is complete:

    Logging in...
    Success, try convox apps

You can run `convox apps` to verify that your client is properly communicating with the system.

    $ convox apps
    APP  STATUS

Congratulations! Convox is set up and ready to deploy apps. Try [deploying](/docs/deploying-an-application) one of our sample applications.

  <h3>Cost Management</h3>

  <p>The Convox Installer by default provisions an Elastic Load Balancer and 3 t2.small instances, giving you 6GB of memory capacity. This runs the Convox API and Private Registry, and leaves room for 10 512MB containers.</p>

  <p>This configuration costs $85/month according to the <a href="http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html">AWS simple cost calculator</a>.</p>

  <p>Each deployed app will provision an additional ELB which starts at $18/month.</p>

  <p>At any time you can <a href="/docs/uninstall-convox">uninstall Convox</a> to delete the resources and stop accruing costs.</p>
